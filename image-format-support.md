Scroll Frames is based on CSS and Javascript, thus, it supports any image format the browser supports. Even if Scroll Frames is able to have multiple instance on a single page, user must be aware of the following notes:

* Vector images frames are supported
* For raster image format, it is highly recommended to use [WebP image format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP)
* Page performances depend on frames sizes and compression.
* Higher amounts of frames - over 200 - decreases performance, the more on low-end devices
* Consider not exceeding an image sequence over 2MB for a single animation
